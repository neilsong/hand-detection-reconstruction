# Monocular RGB Hand-Object Detection and 3D Hand Reconstruction - Demo

A fully-integrated, real-time, multi-focal hand and object detection and 3D hand reconstruction system. Hand detection and state/side classification are used to address limitations in 3D reconstruction model.

# Get the code

`git clone https://github.com/neilsong/hand-detection-reconstruction && cd hand-detection-reconstruction`

# Download and prepare models
## Download model files

- Download model files from [here](http://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/obman/release_models.zip) `wget http://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/obman/release_models.zip` (Note: directly downloading the files is probably faster)
- Unzip `unzip release_models.zip`

## Install python dependencies

- Create conda environment with dependencies: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
- Activate environment: `conda activate hand-det-recon`
- Install detection dependencies: `conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.1 -c pytorch`
- Build detection library: `cd lib && python setup.py build develop`

## Install the MANO PyTorch layer

- Follow the instructions from [here](https://github.com/hassony2/manopth)

### Download the MANO model files

- Go to [MANO website](http://mano.is.tue.mpg.de/)
- Create an account by clicking *Sign Up* and provide your information
- Download Models and Code (the downloaded file should have the format mano_v*_*.zip). Note that all code and data from this download falls under the [MANO license](http://mano.is.tue.mpg.de/license).
- unzip and copy the content of the *models* folder into the misc/mano folder

- Your structure should look like this:

```
hand-detection-reconstruction/
  misc/
    mano/
      MANO_LEFT.pkl
      MANO_RIGHT.pkl
  release_models/
    fhb/
    obman/
    hands_only/

```

# Demo

You can test it on a recorded video or live using a webcam by launching :

`python webcam_demo.py --resume release_models/obman/checkpoint.pth.tar  --hands 2 --checksession 1 --checkepoch 10 --checkpoint 90193`

Concurrency with 3D mesh rendering is achieved by assigning a single to model to a single hand, so the max number of hands must be specified to achieve 1 to 1 concurrency. Models will be distributed as evenly as possible across all available GPUs.
